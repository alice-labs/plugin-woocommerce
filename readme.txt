More than a live chat or a chatbot platform. One tool, all the features you need for sales and support through live conversations.

== Description ==

So your online store’s poppin’ off. Success is great, but it’s getting overwhelming. Buyers and potential customers have questions about products, deliveries, refunds, and exchanges… You want to answer them, but trying to manage CX across all your channels is a fool’s errand. However, if you leave messages unanswered, you’ll damage your brand, and your reputation, and kill your growth. So what do you do? Clone your customer service team? Ask them to work 25 hours a day? Or make it easy on everyone with MyAlice.

MyAlice is modern customer support and social selling platform which helps hundreds of growing ECommerce and DTC brands every day.

HERE’S THE OLD WAY VS THE NEW WAY OF DELIVERING STELLAR CUSTOMER SERVICE

**Old way:** You need to hover on multiple tabs simultaneously to interact with your customers.
**New way:** As your socials and website inventory are connected in one single platform, you can do all the customer interactions like order process, order canceling, and order update in one single browser tab.

**Old way:** Your human agents cannot address all of your customers in an efficient manner 24/7.
**New way:** Our powerful self-service chatbots will help your customers to make a purchase even during the holidays and odd hours. Technically, your online store will be open 24/7 throughout the year for your customers.

**Old way:** There’s no way to track and improve your customer support quality and agent performance in the socials.
**New way:** You can always track and monitor your agents’ conversation quality with the customers, their conversion rates, and response time to improve your customer support every day.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens when I connect my WooCommerce store with MyAlice? =
Once you connect your store, you can view your store inventory, customer details, order details, customer summary, product interactions, and past conversations. You can create or update orders while chatting with your customers directly from MyAlice inbox without switching between platforms.

Next, if you install the [MyAlice plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/myaliceai/) on your store website, you can place a WooCommerce live chat widget on your store website to chat with your store visitors, respond to their queries and guide their shopping journey.

Lastly, you can create chatbots to auto-respond to common queries and use your inventory information to automate the complete purchase journey.

= How many WooCommerce stores can I connect to MyAlice? =
You can create multiple teams and connect one store for each team. The more teams you create, the more stores you have. Additionally, we will be allowing users to connect multiple stores per team by the middle of this year, 2022.

= How do I get the WooCommerce customer data from the time when my store was originally created? =

However, for product interactions, you can view only the data from after you installed [MyAlice plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/myaliceai/) on your store. Please note that the Product Interaction section contains data on which products the customer has viewed, added to the cart, or bought.

= Does the inventory on MyAlice change every time I update my WooCommerce store? =
Yes. Every time you update anything on your store — product, stock, or price, the information is automatically synced on your MyAlice dashboard. On the other hand, when you create an order from MyAlice, the inventory will also be on your WooCommerce dashboard. All in all, WooCommerce and [MyAlice](https://myalice.ai/) sync in real-time.

= How do you handle the payment for products? =
Once an order is created, you will receive a payment link from our end, which you can share with your customers. Customers can then pay as per the payment system set up in your store. If a customer opts for Cash on Delivery, it would be highlighted accordingly in the checkout menu.
